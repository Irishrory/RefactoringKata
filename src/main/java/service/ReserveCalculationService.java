     /* Context:
        When a bank lends money through a contract, it takes a risk.
        In order to reduce this risk, it must put aside a percentage of the total amount loaned.

        Rule:
        If (16 Million <total_amount< 120 Million) Then reserve_percentage = 3%
        If (total_amount > 120 Million) Then reserve_percentage = 10%
